### About me
My name is Adrien, I am a binational French-Canadian analytics engineer with a unique blend of technical expertise that allow me to own each part of a data project from data ingestion to data visualisation. 

I'm passionate about leveraging data insights to drive the energy transition and support sustainable development through data-driven decisions. I have a proven track record in designing ETL pipelines, automating workflows, and delivering actionable analytics to solve complex business challenges. 

After obtaining a Masterâ€™s in Geographic Data Science from the London School of Economics, I joined the Information Lab UK in 2022. After an intensive 4 month training course, I applied my Tableau and Alteryx expertise on high-impact projects during a 12-month placement at BAE Systems, a leading defense and aeronautics company. I then bridged the gap between data analysis and data engineering during a 7-month placement at PrÃªt A Manger, where I used Snowflake to design and maintain efficient ETL pipelines, optimize the data warehouse, and improve reporting accuracy and speed for stakeholders.

In my free time, I love to travel, train Jiu Jitsu, and play football. I'm eager to keep developing my skills and I am confident in my ability to turn data into actionable insights.

Feel free to reach out to discuss data, analytics, potential projects or Data Engineering Employment Opportunities.
